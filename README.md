# Minutes

Minutes is an extension for [Radiant CMS](http://radiantcms.org) that
adds a new page type for meeting minutes.

## Status

Currently, Minutes is nothing more than a proof-of-concept for a client
and is thus a bit of a hack. If anyone else would find this useful, let
me know, and I may clean it up a bit and write some proper specs.
